# openWordnet-PT

## About the RDF conversion

- Based on http://www.w3.org/TR/wordnet-rdf/ and
  http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/lod/wn30/ with some modifications. More
  files from the Princeton distribution were considered and not only
  the database files. More properties and classes are included.
  
- Lisp code used to create the RDF files will be made available soon.

- The wordnet-br.rdf is not a complete wordnet. All relations are in
  the wordnet-en.rdf (the original Princeton WordNet 3.0).

## How the project started?

The initial file was generated by combining the following data:

- Princeton WordNet 3.0 was used to obtain English glosses and English
  terms for synset IDs.

- The unreleased 2010-12 version [UWN] (http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/uwn/) and MENTA  provided candidate
  terms in Portuguese, candidate glosses in Portuguese (from
  Wikipedia), and candidate terms in Spanish.

- The EuroWordNet base concept list (`5000_bc.xml`) provides the base
  concept numbers. The original file was mapped from WordNet 2.0 to
  3.0 using the mappings from
  [WN-Map](http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/web/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21&Itemid=57). When
  multiple mappings for a WordNet 2.0 synset existed, all possible
  WordNet 3.0 synsets were kept. Hence, there may be multiple entries
  with the same base concept number.
