The file has three tab-separated columns: the first is the synset's
Collaborative Interlingual Index (CILI/ILI), the second is the synset
ID from PWN 3.0, and the third is the synset ID from PWN 3.1. Note
that synsets present in PWN3.0 but not in PWN3.1 are in the mapping
file, but those present in PWN3.1 but not in PWN3.0 are missing
(because they appear to have no CILI.)
